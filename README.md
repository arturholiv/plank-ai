# Plank AI - Code Snippet Refactoring & Explanation Tool




## To install and run the project


Backend

```bash
  cd Backend
  npm install
  npm start
```
The .env file is not included in the repository, so you will need to create it yourself based on the .env.example file in the Backend folder.

Add the OPENAI_API_KEY to the .env file.

Frontend

```bash
  cd Frontend
  npm install
  npm start
```
